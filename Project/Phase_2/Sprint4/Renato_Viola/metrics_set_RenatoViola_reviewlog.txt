METRICS REVIEW - LINES OF CODE (Nelson Matos)
Reviewer: Renato Viola

The individual metrics themselves could have been 
explained in more detail, rather than a small note 
section displaying only what their acronyms stand for. 
Aside from that, the purpose of the metrics and how 
they're used was made very clear. The explanation is 
elaborate enough and mentions important concepts, 
while making them easy to understand.
The analysis of the codebase's troublespots was
well handled, as the metrics' values were interpreted
very logically and associated with each other.
The section explaining the metrics further and how their
interpretation isn't so linear is a nice touch, though maybe
a bit out of place after analysing the codebase's troublespots.
The code smells mentioned weren't very elaborated upon,
but then again, the essential was mentioned and the metrics
they affect are there.
