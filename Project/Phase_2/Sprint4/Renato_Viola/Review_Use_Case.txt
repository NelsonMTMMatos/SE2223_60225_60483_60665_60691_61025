USE CASES REVIEW - RESOURCE SUBSYSTEM (Pedro Estr√≥ia)
Reviewer: Renato Viola


DIAGRAM:
The diagram is simple, compact and adequate.

DESCRIPTIONS:

AddResource:

In step 2 of the main flow, the exact properties
comprising a resource didn't need to be described.
Merely stating "The system asks the user to enter
the new resource's properties." would be enough.
That aside, sound use case explanation.



SetResourceProperty:

Nothing to add. Sound explanation.



DeleteResource:

Nothing to add. Sound explanation.



SendEmail:

Step 3 could have been divided into 2 steps.
Nothing to add other than what was mentioned.
