Before explaining each metric, I think there could be an introductory text about this metric and what consists of. 


Abstractness:
The explanation is clear and objective.


Afferent Coupling:
The problem spot is correctly identified. In fact, the preferred values for this metric are in the range of 0 to 500. Therefore, the mentioned package would cause problems if modified. But in general, the Ca average is within range.


Efferent Coupling:
The present problem is too many dependencies on the classes in other packages, so reorganizing the class into different packages may not be the possible solution for the situation.


Distance from the Main Sequence:
The description is understandable and compact. Just didn´t mention which one could cause problems. There are two extreme-value packages, but the distance value should be as low as possible, so the main problem spot is on the package “net.sourceforge.ganttproject.filter”.


Instability:
According to searches, the preferred values of the metric it´s range between 0 to 0.3 or 0.7 to 1. That said, a package should be very stable or unstable, avoiding intermediate stability. And you just referred that the best value is near 1, but values close to 0 are also acceptable.
