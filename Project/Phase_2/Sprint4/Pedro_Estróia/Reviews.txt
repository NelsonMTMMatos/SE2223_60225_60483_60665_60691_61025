Use case (Ana)

Diagram:
- The diagram is assertive and well-specified, but the use cases ViewSummary, ViewLicense and ViewLibraries
  could be aglomerated in just one use case called 'About', as this is the way the interaction with the user occurs.
  These specific interaction could be explained in the description instead, in my opinion. Overall, the diagram is
  complete and very clear.

Description:
- The description is concise, yet complete. However, there is no information regarding the 'About' tab,
  only about the specific tabs, which can be a little misleading, since the actor interacts directly with the
  'About' use case, and only after that with its separate components.
  There's also some information I don't think it's really necessary, like "The User closes the text box".
  Additionaly, in the RecoverProject Use Case, I think the expression 'skip the version' would more adequate than
  'jump the version', as it is the way it is shown in the app.


Code metrics (Joana):
- This description is very illustrative of the chosen metric and straight to the point.
  The troublespots could be a little more explored, referring possible reasons for why those class have those values.
  Apart from that, there's nothing to point out.
