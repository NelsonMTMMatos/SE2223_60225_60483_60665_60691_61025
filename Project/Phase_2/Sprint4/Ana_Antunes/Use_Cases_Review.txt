DIAGRAM:


Overall, this is a well structured diagram, according to the app user interaction.


To be a little more complete, he should also add "Web Server" Use Case, where load and store use cases "include" Web Server Use Case
and adding a label, something like, "load/store at server"), to clarify if is an user or server storage/loader.

The option "Quit" is important to add too(as UseCase), and adding an "Alternative Flow", to when we change something on the project there is a warning by system asking if we want to save it. 



DESCRIPTIONS:


The Use Case descriptions are simple and straightfull, there are only some little details to mention.


Primarily, there is a little mistake in "Import file" Use Case, the "Post  Condition" should have the number 1.

In "Properties" Use Case, it would be more consistent with the other Use Cases, starting by "The User..".

Finally, "Open Project" Use Case should also have the same "Alternative Flow" as "Quit", that I already mentioned above.
