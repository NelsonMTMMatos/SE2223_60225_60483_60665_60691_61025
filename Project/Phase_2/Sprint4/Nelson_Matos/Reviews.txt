Reviews (by Nelson):

Task menu (Joana Wang)


Use case diagram

The diagram was well structured and all of the available menu options such as "Add task", "Set Properties" and 
"Delete Task" were covered. These are pretty straight-forward interaction between the user and the application
so there isn't anything to add.


Use case description


All the use cases were pretty well explained except the fact that in the end of the "Main Flow" of each of them
there's an interaction between the system and an internal intermediate that shouldn'be described or even
mentioned. Usually, use cases tend to hide the intricacies of system procedures in order to keep everything simple
and easy to understand.

Dependency metrics (Pedro Estr√≥ia)

The explanation was well-rounded and it covered all the important parts regarding the 
Dependency Metric. Each of the parameters (and their values) displayed by the plugin had their 
respective correlation with the classes from the Gantt codebase which helped to understand some of
these concepts. There's harshly anything to say about this script as it was meticulously thought through.
