Code smell (Ana Antunes)
 
Duplicate code: 
Firstly, I am totally agreed with that example. The refactoring proposed it´s also a possible solution, but in my opinion, you can give more alternatives even betters.
 
Long parameter list: 
It is a good example for long parameter code smell. However, you could be more specific in identifying the problem in this code and the problems it causes.


Code smell (Renato Viola)

Dead code: 
This is not exactly what I understand by dead code, in the sense that there is no code that is never used/executed.But I agreed with the fact that the method should be clean as there is a commented code which makes the method confused and sloppy.
