Joana Wang-

Code smell:

Class Data

We can see that this class is just encapsulating methods or variables 
that could've easily been put in the class that handles them, there is no extra
functionalities being provided therefore I do agree with the observation
and explanatory statement.


Design Pattern:

Singleton

Despite unmentioned in the explanation we are able to 
observe that its constructor is private which is indicative 
of a Singleton pattern after further analysing the GPCalendarProvider.

Code Smell:

Long method

By the nomenclature and parameters of the method we already know that 
by nature it is gonna be pretty exhaustive regarding conditional checking.
Therefore a common approach is to extract some of the conditions, as in, 
it is better to decompose these verifications into either private methods 
or with object methods as said in the refactoring proposal.


Design Pattern:

Strategy

The explanation was a bit confusing. We mainly use this design pattern
when we find or want an algotithm that's prone to reocurrent changes,
the interface purpose is to declare all the common methods shared 
amongst the algorithms whilst each of them is implemented in a different class.
This way we prevent the occurence of unnecessarily complex and large classes.

Design Pattern:

Iterator

This design pattern is pretty straightforward and easy to understand 
so there's harshly anything to add to the explanation.

Code Smell:

Dead code

After reading the refactoring proposal and checking if there are any
reference calls of the WebStartIDClass class we can conclude that the
class is in fact obsolete. Therefore I agree with what is being stated above.
