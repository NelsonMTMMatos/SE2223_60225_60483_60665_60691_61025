Review:

Design Pattern (Joana Wang):

Singleton

Despite unmentioned in the explanation we are able to 
observe that its constructor is private which is indicative 
of a Singleton pattern after further analysing the GPCalendarProvider.


Design Pattern (Ana Antunes):

Strategy

The explanation was a bit confusing. We mainly use this design pattern
when we find or want an algotithm that's prone to reocurrent changes,
the interface purpose is to declare all the common methods shared 
amongst the algorithms whilst each of them is implemented in a different class.
This way we prevent the occurence of unnecessarily complex and large classes.


Design Pattern (Pedro Estr√≥ia):

Iterator

This design pattern is pretty straightforward and easy to understand 
so there's harshly anything to add to the explanation.
