Review:

Code smell (Joana Wang):

Class Data

We can see that this class is just encapsulating methods or variables 
that could've easily been put in the class that handles them, there is no extra
functionalities being provided therefore I do agree with the observation
and explanatory statement.


Code Smell (Ana Antunes):

Long method

By the nomenclature and parameters of the method we already know that 
by nature it is gonna be pretty exhaustive regarding conditional checking.
Therefore a common approach is to extract some of the conditions, as in, 
it is better to decompose these verifications into either private methods 
or with object methods as said in the refactoring proposal.


Code Smell (Pedro Estr√≥ia):

Dead code

After reading the refactoring proposal and checking if there are any
reference calls of the WebStartIDClass class we can conclude that the
class is in fact obsolete. Therefore I agree with what is being stated above.
