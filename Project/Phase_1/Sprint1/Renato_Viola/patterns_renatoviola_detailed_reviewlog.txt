FACADE (identified by Pedro Estr√≥ia)
	
	The use of the facade pattern could've been explained
	in a more complete manner, such as mentioning how this 
	pattern is intended to minimize dependencies between
	subsystems. Yet, the explanation was accurate and concisive overall.

	
TEMPLATE (identified by Joana Wang)

	The explanation could've been worded a bit better,
	in order to avoid misunderstanding it.
	To say this pattern leaves an algorithm's implementation
	details to its subclasses can be interpreted as a bit of
	a generalization, since not all the steps of the algorithm
	necessarily need to be handled in its subclasses, only some.
	That said, it is still a fairly correct explanation.
	
	
OBSERVER (identified by Ana Antunes)

	The explanation could be elaborated upon further and worded a bit better. 
	The method to add a listener does not state that it is notified when 
	being created, but rather that there might be some sort of callback 
	mechanism to notify it when already "subscribed" to the subject.
	The core concept of the observer pattern was grasped.
