MESSAGE CHAIN (identified by Joana Wang)

	While the explanation itself is quite informative, 
	the refactoring proposal could be more complete, as it lacks
	some rationale behind the use of the law of
	Demeter. Some of what this law states could've been 
	touched upon, such as making it so that the method 
	can only call other methods encapsulated within the 
	same class or within a parameter of the method.
	Other than that, solid explanation and possible solution.


SWITCH STATEMENT (identified by Nelson Matos)

	Both the explanation and the refactoring proposal are
	informative, easy to understand and compact.
	There is nothing to add.


DATA CLASS (identified by Pedro Estr√≥ia)

	The explanation is clear and assertive.
	As for the refactoring proposal, more solutions could've
	been proposed as to merely delete the class and replace it 
	with a variable. Perhaps ponder if such a class could
	have something else placed in it or what other classes 
	handle this very same data.
	Overall, decent explanation and refactoring proposal.
