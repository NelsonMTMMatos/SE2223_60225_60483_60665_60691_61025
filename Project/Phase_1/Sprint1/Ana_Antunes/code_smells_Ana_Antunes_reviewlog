Nelson Identification - Duplicated Code 


Review:

Simple explanation.

Good and straightforward refactoring solution, 
there only should be a little more explicit that we are talking about 2 methods of different classes,"CutAction" and "CopyAction".




Pedro Identification - Comments 


Review:

Direct and accertive explanation.

Good refactoring, giving different solutions and examples to a better "coments" use. 
Particularly he could evidence here the idea of the principle of "say more with fewer words".




Renato Identification - Reminder Comment
