Design Pattern


Proxy Review:

Good explanation, explicit to everyone. 
The ilustrating image isn´t the best matching with the description.
Probably showing the control class that gives the "Documents" acess and a little discription of the image would help to understand this pattern.



Code Smell


Duplicated Code Review:


Simple explanation.

Good and traightforward Refactoring Solution, 
there only should be a little more explicit that we are talking about 2 methods of different classes,"CutAction" and "CopyAction".

Design Pattern


Singleton Review:

Good and clean explanation.
The only detail woud be a more specific explanation to this concrete example, so that everyone could understand better how it´s done there.



Code Smell

Comments Review:


Direct and accertive explanation.

Good Refactoring, giving different solutions and examples to a better "coments" use. 
Particularly he could evidence here the idea of the principle of "say more with fewer words".

Code Smell

Reminder Comment Review:


Good and simple define of the code Smell, with the ilustrating image attached with the details of the code explanation.



Easy and certain solution.



Nelson 

Design Pattern Review:


Simple description and well defined idea with the code snipped above.

The explanation could be a little more complete, adding the fact that the "UndoableEditImpl" is storing a copy of the previous work state,
so, this way, the project can be restored in the future(the restored work can be acessed by "UndoableEditImpl").
