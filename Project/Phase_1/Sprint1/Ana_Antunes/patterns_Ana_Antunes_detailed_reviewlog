|PATTERNS REVIEWED by Ana Antunes|



Nelson Identification - Proxy


Review:

Good explanation, explicit to everyone. 

The ilustrating image isn´t the best matching with the description.
Probably showing the control class that gives the "Documents" acess and a little discription of the image would help to understand this pattern.




Nelson Identification - Memento


Review:

Simple description and well defined idea with the code snipped above.

The explanation could be a little more complete, adding the fact that the "UndoableEditImpl" is storing a copy of the previous work state,
so, this way, the project can be restored in the future(the restored work can be acessed by "UndoableEditImpl").




Pedro Identification - Singleton


Review:

Good and clean explanation.

The only detail woud be a more specific explanation to this concrete example, so that everyone could understand better how it´s done there.
